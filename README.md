AEons of Death
====

First off, anyone who is not a developer or internal tester, please leave this place at once. You don't belong here, and this is private development.

The ones who are allowed to submit directly to this repository are:
- DBThanatos
- Major Cooke

If your account is not on the list above, you must submit via pull request to contribute. You must NOT accept the pull request for me.

Rules for submitting to this repository:

1. Make a fork. Rebase the forks off of the master branch before committing, and separate all changes out to different branches on your fork.
 
2. Make sure to test all changes before submitting a pull request.

3. Detail as many of the changes as possible. A few slips are alright, but I'm going to be looking at each and every single piece of the code.

4. The only way to get code requests put in is through github. No other way will do it.
